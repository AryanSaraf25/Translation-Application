# Voice Translator App

This is a Streamlit web application that lets users record their voice, convert it to text using OpenAI's Whisper model, and translate it into different languages using the GPT-3.5 model.

## Features

- Record audio from your microphone
- Convert speech to text using OpenAI Whisper
- Translate text into multiple languages using GPT-3.5
- Easy-to-use interface
- Secure API key input

## How It Works

1. **Recording Audio**  
   The app uses the `sounddevice` library to capture audio. You can choose how long to record (between 3 and 30 seconds). The audio is saved in WAV format using `scipy`.

2. **Transcription with Whisper**  
   The recorded audio is processed by OpenAI's Whisper model. Whisper is a multilingual speech recognition model that works well even with accents or background noise. It returns the transcribed text from your speech.

3. **Translation**  
   The transcription is sent to GPT-3.5, which translates it into the selected languages. You can choose multiple target languages from the interface.

4. **Display**  
   The app shows the original transcription and the translations side by side. Each translated version is neatly organized and easy to read.

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install streamlit openai sounddevice scipy numpy
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar to use Whisper and GPT features.

## Notes

- This app requires a valid OpenAI API key.
- Audio is recorded and stored locally as `recorded_audio.wav` during each session.
- For best results, use a clear microphone and speak naturally.
